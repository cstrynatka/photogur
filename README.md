# photogur
This repo was for a class assignment done in week_three_day_two where we had to create an app that imitated Imgur. 

One of the biggest difficulties I encountered turned out to be really simple to fix -- ensuring the right photo ID was typed in the address bar after I had made changes in Sublime.
